                       ‚ÄúLet the content lead,‚Äù these words by Stephanie stuck out to me and influences my designs thereafter. {' '}
                       <span>
                           Design is storytelling, and as a designer, I‚Äôm in charge of shaping a compelling narrative, and guiding
                           users through an experience.
                       </span> Whether that means it‚Äôs a call-to-action button, an in-depth analysis, or a
                       link, those decisions are all apart of the journey. This demands a strong understanding of the content,
                       motivations, and needs of the user. Through empathy and knowing what I‚Äôm presenting to the user, I‚Äôm able
                       to deliver a message effectively and evoke thoughts, feelings, and emotions to craft a memorable user experience.

                   <p>
                   Design isn‚Äôt just about pretty UI, but rather <span>balancing accessibility even at the expense of aesthetics.</span> Initially,
                   this was challenging because I was too focused on making it look pretty. Computer Courage was quick to inform me what
                   was accessible and how to fix my design in the right direction. I wasn‚Äôt staying too far off because I still had to meet
                   the UC Berkeley accessibility standards, but there was room for improvement on my end.

                   <p>
                   I learned so much and made better design decisions when I got input from the team. <span>
                       Each member had a lot to share and brought
                       different perspectives
                   </span> that informed me with better insights of their needs. Involving them in the design process ensured that 
                   each element was necessary and made me more confident when making decisions. Together we crafted a powerful user experience.

               Thank you to Austin P, Justina R, Nathalie M, Nina I, and Stephanie W, who were very patient with me during these 4 months. 
               I appreciate your willingness to engage with my questions, provide feedback, and create such a welcoming environment. This 
               was an extremely invaluable experience and although it was a tough and demanding task to conquer alone, I‚Äôm super happy and 
               proud of the end result. I can only hope that this website will make a significant impact on the future of BFI.
                </p>
                <p>
                Special thanks to Stephanie, who truly helped shape this website alongside me. Your guidance, support, and unwavering belief 
                in my abilities validated and empowered me to exceed expectations. You encouraged me to become a more skilled designer. I 
                couldn‚Äôt have done with without the BFI team. This collaborative project was unlike anything I‚Äôve done before, and I know it 
                has undoubtably influenced my design approach for future endeavors.
