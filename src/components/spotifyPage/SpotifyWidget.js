                  As an avid music listener, I often found myself wanting quick access to song lyrics and essential music information 
                  without navigating away from my current task. The existing experience didn't provide a seamless 
                  way to glance at lyrics or song details.

                    In the vast realm of online resources, seeking inspiration is crucial. It's important to see how others have tackled similar 
                    problems as it provides valuable insights. However, I must note that it's essential to tread carefully, 
                    <span>ensuring inspiration doesn't transform into replication.</span> You can't copy and recreate a designers' work, call it 
                    your own and take credit. Now, while couldn't find an exact match for my vision, apps like  
                    <span>Sleeve 2, MD Vinyl, and MiniPlayer Widget </span> offered intriguing features and caught my attention for this project.

                    While I was designing, I realized that there are two slightly different mindsets when it comes to approaching personal projects 
                    versus client-driven ones. When I'm designing for myself, there's a lot more room to explore solutions freely without the added pressure 
                    of shipping into production and deployment. It feels like a <span>creative playground, allowing uninhibited experimentation and niche problem 
                    solving catered to my own preferences. </span> Whereas client projects present structured challenges, demanding adherence to guidelines, collaboration 
                    with a team, and require an emphasis on user needs.<span> Learning to navigate through the mindsets allow me to grow as a designer and find the 
                    right balance. </span>
